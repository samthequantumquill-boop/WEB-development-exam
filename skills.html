        <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
        <p>1. Smart Home Automation System

Developed an IoT-based home automation system to control appliances like lights and fans remotely.
The system uses sensors and a microcontroller (such as Arduino/ESP8266) to automate devices through a mobile application or web interface.
This project helped me understand sensors, actuators, and real-time data control.</p>

        <p>2. Smart Street Light System

Designed an intelligent street light system that automatically turns ON or OFF based on ambient light and motion detection.
LDR and IR sensors were used to reduce power consumption by switching lights only when required.
This project focuses on energy efficiency and automation.</p>

      <article class="card card-3">
        <p>3. Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

Created an IoT system to monitor temperature and humidity using sensors like DHT11/DHT22.
The collected data is displayed on a serial monitor or cloud dashboard for real-time monitoring.
This project improved my knowledge of sensor integration and data handling.</p>
